    - **Problem Statement:** Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations (insert, remove, replace) required to convert one string into the other.
    - **Formula:** `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + (s1[i] != s2[j]))`
    - **Explanation:** `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum edit distance between prefixes of s1 and s2.
