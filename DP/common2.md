Certainly! Let's add another bullet point for each problem describing the intuition in detail:

1. **Distinct Subsequences:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given two strings s and t, return the count of distinct subsequences of t in s.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (s[i-1] == t[j-1] ? dp[i-1][j-1] : 0)`
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters in s that match the first `j` characters in t.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t.
   - **Intuition:** At each step, we have two choices: either include the current character in the subsequence or skip it. The recurrence relation captures these choices by summing up the number of subsequences with and without the current character.

2. **Minimum Path Sum:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given a 2D grid, find the minimum sum path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum path to reach cell (i, j) from the top-left corner.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
   - **Intuition:** The minimum sum to reach each cell is the sum of the current cell's value and the minimum sum of reaching the cell from either above or from the left.

3. **Palindrome Partitioning II:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given a string s, partition it such that every substring is a palindrome. Minimize the number of partitions.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + 1)` for all j <= i if s[j...i] is a palindrome.
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of partitions for the first `i` characters in s.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2).
   - **Intuition:** To minimize the number of partitions, we iterate through all possible ending points of a palindrome and choose the one that requires the fewest partitions.

4. **Maximum Subarray:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])`
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index `i`.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n).
   - **Intuition:** At each step, we decide whether to extend the current subarray or start a new one based on the current element. The maximum subarray sum at each index is the maximum of including the current element or starting a new subarray.

5. **Wildcard Matching:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Implement wildcard pattern matching with '*' and '?'.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] (if p[j-1] == s[i-1] or p[j-1] == '?') or dp[i][j-1] (if p[j-1] == '*')`
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters in s match the first `j` characters in p.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and p.
   - **Intuition:** The dynamic programming approach here is driven by the need to handle wildcard characters '*' and '?'. The recurrence relation accounts for matching characters, '*' as zero characters, and '*' as one or more characters.

6. **Jump Game II:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of non-negative integers, each element represents the maximum jump length, find the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` for all j < i if it is possible to jump from j to i.
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of jumps to reach index `i`.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n).
   - **Intuition:** The dynamic programming approach focuses on finding the minimum number of jumps required to reach each index. At each step, we consider all possible previous indices that can reach the current index and choose the one that minimizes the number of jumps.

7. **Maximum Product Subarray:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Find the contiguous subarray with the largest product.
   - **Formula:** `dp_max[i] = max(nums[i], dp_max[i-1] * nums[i], dp_min[i-1] * nums[i])`
   - **Explanation:** `dp_max[i]` represents the maximum product of a subarray ending at index `i`, and `dp_min[i]` represents the minimum product.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n).
   - **Intuition:** Unlike the maximum subarray sum problem, handling negative numbers introduces complexity. The recurrence relation considers the possibility of negative numbers causing the maximum product to become the minimum and vice versa.

8. **Interleaving String:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given s1, s2, and s3, determine if s3 is formed by interleaving s1 and s2.
   - **Formula:** `dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] && s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]) || (dp[i][j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])`
   - **Explanation:** `dp[i][j]` represents whether s3[0...i+j-1] is an interleaving of s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1].
   - **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s1 and s2.
   - **Intuition:** The goal is to check if s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2. The recurrence relation captures the choices of interleaving characters from s1 and s2 while maintaining the correct order.

9. **Trapping Rain Water:**
   - **Problem Statement:** Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
   - **Formula:** `water[i] = min(max_left[i], max_right[i]) - height[i]`
   - **Explanation:** `max_left[i]` and `max_right[i]` represent the maximum heights to the left and right of bar i, respectively.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n).
   - **Intuition:** To trap water at each bar, we need to consider the height of the bar and the maximum heights to its left and right. The formula calculates the amount of water that can be trapped at each bar.

10. **Regular Expression Matching:**
   

 - **Problem Statement:** Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
    - **Formula:** `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] (if p[j-1] == s[i-1] or p[j-1] == '.') || (dp[i][j-2] (if p[j-1] == '*' and matches zero characters) || dp[i-1][j] (if p[j-1] == '*' and matches one or more characters))`
    - **Explanation:** `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters in s match the first `j` characters in p.
    - **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and p.
    - **Intuition:** Regular expression matching introduces wildcard characters '*' and '.', and the recurrence relation handles the possibilities of matching characters, '*' as zero characters, and '*' as one or more characters.
